This project is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to query a product and supplier database using natural language. It utilizes an open-source LLM to fetch and summarize relevant information from a PostgreSQL database. The chatbot is built using Python with LangGraph for workflow orchestration and FastAPI for the backend. The frontend is developed in React for a responsive user experience.

Key Features:

Natural Language Querying: Users can ask questions about products and suppliers.
LangGraph Integration: Manages agent workflows to process queries efficiently.
PostgreSQL Database: Stores product and supplier data with optimized queries.
LLM Summarization: Provides concise and relevant answers using an open-source LLM (e.g., Hugging Face models).
Modern Web UI: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.
State Management: Utilizes Redux or Context API for managing application state.
API Communication: Axios is used to interact with the backend efficiently.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python, FastAPI, LangGraph
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios
Database: PostgreSQL
AI Model: Hugging Face models for summarization
